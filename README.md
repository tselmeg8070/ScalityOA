## Exercise Overview
Your mission is to craft a React application featuring a counter with an increment button.
The application should meet the following requirements:
- Fibonacci Suite Indicator: Display a clear signal next to the counter if its current value aligns with a Fibonacci sequence number.
- Threshold Alerts: As the counter approaches a predefined threshold, trigger a user-friendly alert to notify the user about its proximity to a higher value.
- Threshold Lock: Upon crossing a secondary threshold, prevent further counter increments. Provide a user-friendly explanation for this limitation.
- Bonus Challenge:
Design your solution with user experience at the forefront. Consider your solution with adaptability in mind, allowing for easy adjustments to the threshold criteria in the future.
